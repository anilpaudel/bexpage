Examples chosen from local industrial situations with particular attention paid to
the basic measurement requirements, accuracy, and specific hardware
employed environmental conditions under which the instruments must operate,
signal processing and transmission, output devices:
a) Instrumentation for a power station including all electrical and nonelectrical
parameters.
b) Instrumentation for a wire and cable manufacturing and bottling plant.
c) Instrumentation for a beverage manufacturing and bottling plant.
d) Instrumentation for a complete textile plant; for example, a cotton mill
from raw cotton through to finished dyed fabric.
e) Instrumentation for a process; for example, an oil seed processing plant
from raw seeds through to packaged edible oil product.
f) Instruments required for a biomedical application such as a medical clinic or
hospital.
g) Other industries can be selected with the consent of the Subject teacher.
Practical:
The laboratory exercises deal interfacing techniques using microprocessor or
microcontrollers. There will be about six lab sessions which should cover at least
following:
1. Simple and Handshake data transfer using PPI.
2. Basic I/O device interfacing like keyboard, seven segments, motors etc
3. Analog to Digital interfacing
4. Digital to Analog interfacing
5. Design exercise (small group project)
Study in detail the instrumentation requirements of a particular proposed or
existing industrial plant and design an instrumentation and data collection
system for that particular industrial plant. The final report should present the
instrumentation requirements in terms of engineering specifications, the
hardware solution suggested, a listing of the particular devices chosen to satisfy
the requirements, appropriate system flow diagrams, wiring diagrams, etc. to
show how the system would be connected and operated.
