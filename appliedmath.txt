Course Objective
This course focuses on several branches of applied mathematics. The students
are exposed to complex variable theory and a study of the Fourier and
Z‐Transforms, topics of current importance in signal processing. The course
concludes with studies of the wave and heat equations in Cartesian and polar
coordinates.
